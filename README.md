This is a mod for one thing. Stacking raid farms. There is a small chance for Vexes to spawn, if the user is AFK at the raid farm, it could be fatal for players.
So this mod is basically listening for Vex sounds. Mainly ambient Vex sounds because that's the first sound they make when they get summoned.

If a Vex makes a sound, the mod will open the Advancements Screen and this basically stops the game like the Pause Screen. When the user gets out of the popped up screen, a cooldown will be set. Vexes take about 3-4 minutes to despawn, so the default cooldown is 210 seconds. Of course the cooldown can be changed between a minimum of 10 seconds and a maximum of 600 seconds. 

The listening can be toggled by the user. By toggling, the cooldown will end.
